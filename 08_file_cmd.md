# 📁 `file` Command in Linux

## 🔹 Purpose:
The `file` command is used to **identify the type of a file** by inspecting its **content**, not just its name or extension.

---

## 📌 Syntax:
```bash
file filename
```

---

## ✅ Practical Examples

### 🔹 1. File Created with `touch` (Empty)
```bash
touch a.txt
file a.txt
```
Output:
```
a.txt: empty
```

---

### 🔹 2. After Adding Text with `nano`
```bash
nano a.txt
file a.txt
```
Output:
```
a.txt: ASCII text
```

---

### 🔹 3. Misleading Extension (Fake MP4)
```bash
touch a.mp4
nano a.mp4    # Added some text
file a.mp4
```
Output:
```
a.mp4: ASCII text
```

➡️ Even though `.mp4` suggests a video file, it's actually treated as a text file because the **content is text**.

---

### 🔹 4. Proper HTML Content
```bash
touch a.html
nano a.html
# Add: <html><body>Hello</body></html>
file a.html
```
Output:
```
a.html: HTML document, ASCII text
```

✅ The `file` command intelligently recognizes file type by analyzing the content.

## 🧠 Summary Table

| File Command Input | File Content     | Output from `file`             |

| `a.txt`            | plain text       | `ASCII text`                   |
| `a.mp4`            | plain text       | `ASCII text`                   |
| `a.html`           | HTML code        | `HTML document, ASCII text`    |
