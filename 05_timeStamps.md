# üïí Linux File Timestamps Cheatsheet

Every file in Linux has **three main timestamps**:

| Timestamp | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **mtime** (Modified Time) | Last time the **file content** was modified |
| **ctime** (Change Time) | Last time the **metadata** (permissions, ownership, name) was changed |
| **atime** (Access Time) | Last time the file was **read or accessed** |

---

## üîç Viewing Timestamps with `ls`

### 1. `ls -l` ‚Üí Shows **mtime**
```bash
ls -l

2. ls -lc ‚Üí Shows ctime
Shows when the file metadata was changed (renamed, permissions, ownership).

3. ls -lu ‚Üí Shows atime
Shows the last time the file was accessed (e.g., read using cat, less, etc.).

Use stat to See All Timestamps
