# Shell and Bash Notes

## 1. What is a Shell?

- A **Shell** is a **Command-Line Interface (CLI)** that allows users to interact with the operating system by typing commands.
- It serves as a **mediator between the user and the OS**, enabling:
  - Running programs  
  - Managing files  
  - Configuring system settings  
  - Performing various system tasks
- Shells also support **scripting**, allowing automation of tasks via a sequence of commands (scripts).

- Advanced shell that includes features from:
  - Bash
  - Korn Shell
  - tcsh
- Supports:

## 4. Windows Shells

### i. Command Prompt (`cmd.exe`)
- Traditional CLI for Windows.
- Lacks many features found in Unix shells.
- Provides a basic command-line interface.
