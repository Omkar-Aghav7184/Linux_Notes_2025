1. Bash is part of Shell

2. A Shell is a command-line interface (CLI) that allows users to interact with an operating system by typing commands.

3. It Serves as a mediator between the user and the operating system ,enabling users to run programs ,manage files,
configure system settings,and perform various other tasks.

4. Shells also support scripting, allowing users to write scripts (sequence of commands) to automate tasks.

5. There are several types of shells,and they can be broadly categorized into two main groups:
Unix-like shells, and Windows Shells

6. Unix Shells
i. Bourne Shell(sh): The Bourne Shell was one of the earliest unix shells and served as the basis for many subsequent shells. It provides basic functionality and is often used for scripting.
ii. Bash(Bourne Again SHell): Bash is the default shell for many Unix-like operating systems,including Linux and macos. It extends the capabilities of the original Bourne Shell and incoporates features from other shells like the Korn shell and the C shell.

iii. Korn Shell(ksh): The Korn shell was developed by David korn as an enhancement to the Bourne  Shell. It includes from both the Bourne Shell and the C shell, making it a powerful and user -friendly shell.

iv. C Shell(csh): The C Shell  has a syntax that is somewhat c-like and was  developed to provide interactive features not parent in the original  Bourne Shell. Its successor ,tcsh,is an improved version with additional features.

v. Zsh(Z Shell): Zsh is an extended shell that incorporates features from bash, ksh, and tcsh. It includes advanced scripting capabilities and interactive features for users.

7. Windowd Shells

i. Command Prompt(cmd.exe): The command prompt is the traditional command-line interface for windows. While it lacks some advanced features found in Unix-like shells, it provides a basic command-line environment.

ii. PowerShell: PowerShell is a more recent and powerful shell for windows. It is designed for automation and task scripting,with focus on managing system components through a command-line  interface.
